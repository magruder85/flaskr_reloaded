Using the Flaskr tutorial, I intend to follow through on the remaining suggestions on the [Keep Developing](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/tutorial/next/) page.

* A detail view to show a single post. Click a postâ€™s title to go to its page. <span style="color:green">Complete</span>
* Like / unlike a post. <span style="color:yellow">Mostly complete, code coverage issues.</span>
* Comments.
* Tags. Clicking a tag shows all the posts with that tag.
* A search box that filters the index page by name.
* Paged display. Only show 5 posts per page.
* Upload an image to go along with a post.
* Format posts using Markdown.
* An RSS feed of new posts.*
